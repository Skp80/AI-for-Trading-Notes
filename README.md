# AI-for-Trading-Notes

This repository contains my personal handwritten notes for the Udacity's AI for Trading Course.

I am also collating some useful scripts from Term 1 inside 'Cool Scripts from Term 1' folder. It is currently a work in progress and scripts from Term 2 will follow soon.  

For Projects 7 and 8 I chose not to create any notes as they were coding heavy (and I was running short on time to finish the ND). However, I might go back and create notes on them sometime in the future. Depends.  

Please download the PDF files direclty, they sometimes don't open properly inside the GitHub interface since they have a large size (50MB+).
