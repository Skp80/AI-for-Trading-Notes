# AI-for-Trading-Notes

This repository contains my personal handwritten notes for the Udacity's AI for Trading Course.

Notes for Term 1 are complete. 
Term 2 notes are a work in progress. 

I am also collating some useful scripts from Term 1 inside 'Cool Scripts from Term 1' folder. It is currently a work in progress and scripts from Term 2 will follow soon. 

Please download the PDF files direclty, they sometimes don't open properly inside the GitHub interface since they have a large size (50MB+).
